### About this folder

Put the files that you would upload to a webserver in this folder. InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop files do not belong here, nor do original high-resolution images.

### More on the starter project

The code structure is designed for clarity rather than for browser performance. (Notably, we break CSS out into several files, to help keep code organized.) Even so, the slowdowns will be insignificant for most student/personal sites, and the speed fixes are easy to make.

This project includes elements from HTML5 Boilerplate (see docs/h5bp/ for more).
